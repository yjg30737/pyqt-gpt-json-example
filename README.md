## Detailed Description
This is an implementation of GPT response - JSON FORMAT mode in a GUI.

The main purpose of this software is to output a json response based on the given attributes (rows and columns, fields and properties), and to display it in a table format :)

Currently, the topic set to games by DEFAULT. If you enter a game and the properties you want to know about the game, GPT will output the property values for each game and show them in the table.

You can change the topic and add fields for another topic (for example, movies) and obtain data about it.

This is a very simple example that can be utilized in desktop software.
